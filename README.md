# Analyzing-Online-Ticket-Sales-with-Amazon-Redshift
This project involves analyzing online ticket sales data using Amazon Redshift, a data warehousing solution provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The dataset consists of sales activity from a fictional ticketing website where users buy and sell tickets for various events such as sporting events, shows, and concerts. The analysis focuses on understanding sales trends, user behavior, and identifying opportunities for optimization.

Key Analysis Steps:

Data Exploration: The project begins with exploring the event data stored in Amazon Redshift, including details such as event name, venue, category, and date.
Data Joining: Multiple tables within the data warehouse, including event, venue, category, and date, are joined to consolidate relevant information for analysis.
Sales Analysis: Sales data, including listings and actual sales transactions, are examined to understand sales patterns, pricing dynamics, and user interactions.
User Profiling: Users who are the most active sellers and buyers are identified based on their transaction history and ticket sales volume.
Category Analysis: Sales performance across different event categories (e.g., concerts, shows) is analyzed to identify category-specific trends and insights.
Unrealized Sales: Users with high potential for additional sales, based on the discrepancy between listed tickets and actual sales, are identified for targeted advertising efforts.
Bonus Visualization: Sales trends over time are visualized using line plots, segmented by event categories, to provide a comprehensive view of sales dynamics throughout the year.

This project showcases proficiency in SQL query writing, data analysis with Amazon Redshift, and the ability to derive actionable insights from large-scale datasets to optimize online ticket sales operations.
